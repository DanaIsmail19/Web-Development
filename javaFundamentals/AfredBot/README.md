Bruce Wayne's loyal and tireless Butler and best friend, Alfred is getting ready to take some vacation time. He needs to program the Batcomputer to assume his duties through a fully robotic avatar. Although he has mastered numerous arts such as rose breeding, various fields of engineering, nanotechnology, and biotechnology, he doesn't feel like programming his own conversational responses. Therefore, he has contracted you to implement the AlfredQuotes library class. It must rival the "largely unhelpful Alexis", a talking home appliance that Master Wayne bought on Tropics, a large online retailer. To the bat-code!

For this assignment you will have two files,  CafeUtil.java and  TestCafe.java. You will be writing all your methods inside the CafeUtil class. The second file is a test file, TestCafe.java that includes the main method. We have provided the code in its entirety for testing, and you can copy and paste from it from the bottom of this module, but be sure to instantiate your class in the testing file!

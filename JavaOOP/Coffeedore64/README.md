So far, we've modularized our original Cafe Java and Business Logic code so that the codebase stores data in a tidy way that is more analogous to real life. We now are storing specific types of things that can do stuff, or rather, object instances that can invoke class methods. Now we're going to make our interactions between these objects a bit more dynamic, by adding user interactivity!
